# `3. Installation`

### installing mongodb
see https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mongodb-on-ubuntu-18-04


### a- Creating our Mongoose model

On your terminal, run:

```bash
yarn add mongoose or npm install --save mongoose
```

I chose mongoose for this tutorial. But you can, of course, choose any package you want to deal with MongoDB.

### b- Install dependencies:


```bash
npm install
```

# `4. Running the Application`

- To run the application, open a command prompt and navigate to project directory. Run command as
```bash
npm start
```
- If you are running for the first time, then before you run the start command, initialize the project with
```bash
npm init
```
This will start the node server at port 6002 and you can access the application at url http://localhost:6002/

```bash 
$ npm test
```

git init
git add .
git commit -m "user profile processing !!"

### Create a new repository on the command line
```bash

git add .
git commit -m "edited README and added dev.md and added authentification system"
git remote add origin https://github.com/tounsils/hr.git
